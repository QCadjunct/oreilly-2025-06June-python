        Python supports several numeric types. Let's explore the most fundamental ones:

        - Integer objects: Whole numbers with unlimited precision
        - Floating-point objects: Numbers with decimal points
        - Complex number objects: Numbers with real and imaginary parts

        # Chapter 5: Numbers and Expressions
    
        Welcome to this interactive exploration of Python's numeric objects and operations! 
        This notebook will guide you through hands-on experiments with Python's core numeric types.
    
        ## Learning Objectives
        By the end of this interactive session, you will be able to:
        - [ ] Work with Python's core numeric types (integers, floats, complex numbers)
        - [ ] Apply arithmetic operators and understand operator precedence
        - [ ] Convert between different numeric bases (decimal, hex, octal, binary)
        - [ ] Use advanced numeric types (Decimal, Fraction, Set)
        - [ ] Perform bitwise operations and understand their applications
        - [ ] Apply numeric built-in functions and methods effectively
