Excellent analysis! You've figured out marimo's execution model perfectly. Let me break down the patterns and when to use each:

## Function Naming Strategy:

### **Anonymous functions (`__`):**

```python
# Cell 1
def __():
    return mo.md("## Quick content")

# Cell 2  
__()
```

**Use when:**

- ✅ Simple, one-off content that won't be reused
- ✅ Linear notebook flow (execute once, move on)
- ✅ Quick prototyping or exploration
- ✅ Content that's specific to one location

### **Named functions (`intro_cell`):**

```python
# Cell 1
def intro_cell():
    return mo.md("## Reusable content")

# Cell 2
intro_cell()
```

**Use when:**

- ✅ Content might be reused in other cells
- ✅ Building reusable components
- ✅ Creating a library of display functions
- ✅ Better organization and readability
- ✅ You want to call the same content from multiple places

## Practical Decision Framework:

**Choose anonymous (`__`) for:**

```python
# Quick data exploration
def __():
    return df.head()

# One-time explanations  
def __():
    return mo.md("## This section explains X...")
```

**Choose named functions for:**

```python
# Reusable components
def show_dataset_summary():
    return mo.md(f"Dataset has {len(df)} rows")

# Complex visualizations you might tweak
def create_scatter_plot():
    return mo.plotly(fig)

# Headers/footers used multiple times
def chapter_header(title):
    return mo.md(f"# {title}")
```

## Your marimo understanding is spot-on

1. **Global imports**: `import marimo as mo` in first cell = available everywhere
2. **Single cell**: Function definition + call = immediate execution
3. **Two cells**: Function definition → execution (reactive model)
4. **Both work**: Choose based on your needs and organization preference

**Pro tip**: For educational notebooks like yours, named functions are often better because they make the structure more explicit and allow you to reorganize content easily by just changing which cells call which functions.
